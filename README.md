# Credit_Card_Churn_Impact
 
Credit Card Churn Rate Prediction using XGBoost

This project is aimed at predicting the churn rate of credit card customers using XGBoost. Churn rate is the percentage of customers who discontinue using a service over a given period of time. The ability to predict churn rate is important for businesses as it allows them to identify customers who are likely to leave and take measures to retain them.

In this project, we will use a dataset containing information about credit card customers and their transaction history. We will preprocess the data, build an XGBoost model, and evaluate its performance in predicting the churn rate of customers.

Dataset
The dataset used in this project is provided by Kaggle. It contains information about 10,000 credit card customers and their transaction history. The dataset includes various features such as customer demographics, transaction amount, and transaction type.
